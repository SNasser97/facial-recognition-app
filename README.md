## Face Detection
 1. This app uses the [Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection-image-recognition-model-a403429f2ddf4b49b307e318f00e528b-detection)
 2. Built using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

### How it works
 You simply grab an image URL and paste it into the field and hit detect!
 Depending on the image you provide it can detect the face or faces and display a box highlighting the face
